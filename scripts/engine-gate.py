def record_matches(_args):
    """provenance.json still hashes the bytes on disk: the derived files are not older than the
    overlay they were derived from (#192).

    This compares and nothing else. It re-derives nothing and writes nothing, because **an engine
    cannot author this record.** `factory produce` writes it from a rules-factory checkout: it
    names that checkout's commit, hashes every one of the factory's recipe files, and lists what
    the run itself wrote. An engine has five vendored modules and no run to observe. Decisively, an
    engine can re-derive its `*.g.cs` but not scripts/validate.sh, this file, scripts/map-overlay.py,
    scripts/factory/*.py or the CI workflow -- all recorded as generated, all hashed here. An
    engine-side rewrite would hash whatever is on disk and hand a fresh matching SHA-256 to a
    hand-edited gate, and a gate that re-blesses its own bytes proves nothing.

    **What is compared, and what deliberately is not.** Every `generated` entry, every `managed`
    entry, and the whole of the overlay -- `buildInputs[overlay/*.json]` -- and no other build
    input. Adding a
    PackageReference, a project to the solution or a version to Directory.Packages.props are
    engine-owned acts (decision 0018); making each of them require a re-produce before this goes
    green would produce a gate people route around. Holding the whole of `buildInputs` is
    `factory provenance`'s job, where a real re-produce can tell a legitimate addition from drift.
    The overlay is different in kind: it is the *input to generation*, and appears in `buildInputs`
    only because it happens to be engine-owned. **It is the only comparison that catches every form
    of an unfinished overlay edit.** The `generated` hashes catch one form -- an overlay edit
    followed by `regenerate --write`, which leaves the `*.g.cs` differing from what the record
    hashed -- but an overlay edited and nothing else run moves no generated byte, and only the
    overlay comparison sees it. The engine's backlog used to be hashed here too and could never see
    either form: an item file that still lists an entry someone has since implemented is
    *unchanged*, so its hash matches. What moved is the overlay, and that is the fact this names.

    **A set, not a file (#247).** The overlay is a directory now, so "the overlay as the record
    hashed it" is the whole set of paths and hashes, and the comparison is symmetric: a file whose
    bytes moved is `edited`, a file on disk the record does not list is `added`, and a file the
    record lists that is not on disk is `removed`. Comparing only the files the record happens to
    name would let a new entry's evidence in without a re-produce -- the generated `*.g.cs` would
    still be the old ones, and nothing would say so -- and comparing only the files on disk would
    let one be deleted the same way.

    An engine with no implemented entry has an empty overlay and always did; that is not "examined
    nothing", it is a complete comparison of a set that is empty on both sides, and the check that
    tells the two apart is `provenanceFormat`. A record written before #247 has format 3 or less and
    describes a layout this engine does not have, so it is refused here and named as what it is: a
    record that predates the split.

    **The one file a run may declare, and what it must prove to (#336).** `factory verify` can run
    restore and the gate on another locally installed SDK, because a machine without the pinned one
    could otherwise run neither. The only way to select it is global.json, which is a managed file
    this step hashes -- so the two mechanisms used to disagree about which tree was under
    verification: the override deliberately wrote bytes this step then called a violation, and the
    run that "passed" had been told its own global.json was forged. Neither claim was wrong; the
    handoff between them said nothing.

    The answer is a declaration, not an exemption. `$FACTORY_SDK_OVERRIDE_RECORDED` names a file
    holding the bytes the record hashes, `$FACTORY_DOTNET_SDK_OVERRIDE` names the SDK they were
    re-pinned to, and this step proves **two** things where it otherwise proves one: the declared
    original is the file the record hashes, and what is on disk is exactly that original with its
    SDK version replaced. The tree under verification is therefore known, exactly, and it is not the
    recorded tree -- so this step says so, in the note above the comparison and in the ok line
    itself, and `verify` says it again at the end of the run. A declaration is refused under CI=true,
    and an incomplete, unreadable or unbacked one is refused too; refusing it leaves the exact
    comparison in force, so an undeclared re-pin fails exactly as it did before any of this existed.
