"""M1 of #3: intake. Open a map package, prove the corpus in hand is the one it was mapped from.

An engine is only as right as the correspondence between its map and its corpus, so nothing
is scaffolded until seven things are shown, in this order, and any one that is not shown is a
refusal rather than a warning:

  1. **The package is a map package.** A `.nupkg` built by `tools/pack-map.py` (0015): its
     `build/<id>.props` declares exactly one `RulesFactoryMap` item, and the map, manifest,
     `ConsumerChecker` and `Verification` record that item names are all inside the archive. A package without its
     checker (pre-2.0.0 backgammon, or a hand-built zip) is not one an engine's gate can use
     (#51), so it is refused, not tolerated. The checker's bytes are read so provenance can
     record their digest; they are never run (below).
  2. **The map is in a schemaVersion this factory reads.** The supported set is
     `SCHEMA_VERSIONS` in the factory's own `tools/check-map.py`, not a copy kept here. A map in
     any other version is refused, naming the versions that would be accepted.
  3. **The package binds the artifacts its publish gate verified.** Its decision-0048
     verification record names the map, manifest and packaged checker by SHA-256 and names every
     corpus the map cites by sourceId, hashDerivation and contentHash. Those artifact digests are
     compared with the actual package members; a legacy package with no binding is refused.
  4. **Every cited corpus is admitted, and is verifiable here.** Its `licence` is public domain,
     an admitted open licence, or `licensed-proprietary` declaring `distribution: private`
     (0028, 0068), and its `verification` is `committed-copy` (0013). A local-copy corpus is NOT
     VERIFIED. The package's distribution requirement is the strictest of its corpora's, and
     `private` restricts where the engine may go, never what is established about it.
  5. **Every resolved corpus file is the exact identity this package was verified against.**
     The map's principal `baseline` agrees with the manifest; each supplied file is built and
     verified by rules-corpus from the build definition committed beside it (rulescorpus.py,
     #558), and the baseline rules-corpus computes must equal the manifest's declaration --
     contentHash, hashDerivation and asOf -- and the package verification record's contentHash
     for that same sourceId. A missing definition or expectation, a build or verification
     rules-corpus refuses, and a malformed declared digest all fail closed.
  6. **The corpora agree on whether the engine may draw random values** (0019): `randomness` is
     `none` or `seeded`. A package whose manifest predates the field declares nothing, and is
     refused rather than read as `none`: the answer is the corpus's, and a default would be the
     factory's.
  7. **The factory's own checker passes, in its consumer phase**, on the packaged map and
     manifest. Before any overlay exists this is the map exactly as published, so a failure
     here means the map does not hold under the checks its engine will run, and no engine
     should be built on it.

**A package is data, never code (0016).** Nothing here executes, imports or `exec`s a byte
that came out of a package: the map and manifest are parsed as JSON, and the checker that
judges them is `tools/check-map.py` beside this factory, loaded from the factory's own
checkout and versioned with it. The package's `ConsumerChecker` is for the engine's build,
which chose that package by exact version and lock-file hash. The factory has chosen nothing
yet when it opens a package, so running what the package names would hand the package the
privileges of whoever runs the factory before a single claim in it had been checked.

**Nothing is read without a limit (#187, #229).** All seven checks above run on bytes intake
already holds, so the size of what it takes in is the one thing it must decide before it has
verified anything. Every read is bounded before it starts, and by a cap named here:

  * a package is refused over `MAX_PACKAGE_BYTES`, whatever its source -- a download is stopped
    and deleted at that many bytes as it streams, and a `.nupkg` named on the command line or
    found in the NuGet global packages folder is measured before it is hashed or opened;
  * an archive is refused over `MAX_ARCHIVE_ENTRIES` entries, before any member is read;
  * a member is refused unread over `MAX_MEMBER_BYTES` uncompressed, or over a compression ratio
    of `MAX_COMPRESSION_RATIO`;
  * a corpus is refused over `MAX_CORPUS_BYTES`, measured before it is opened and counted again
    as it is read in chunks.

The package and the corpus the operator names are theirs, so this is about not exhausting their
machine, not about trust.

**A nuspec or props that declares a DTD is refused before it is parsed (#210).** The size caps
bound the bytes intake reads, not what an XML parser makes of them: `xml.etree` expands internal
entities, so a nuspec of a few kilobytes can declare its way to gigabytes inside the parser. A
DTD is a small instruction set, and admitting one is admitting a little code (0016); nothing
`tools/pack-map.py` builds carries one, so a document type declaration is refused outright rather
than its expansion bounded.

What intake cannot do: tell whether the map is *right* about the corpus (the publish gate's
locator checkers and review did that), or whether a newer version of the package exists.

Standard library only.
