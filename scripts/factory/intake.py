"""M1 of #3: intake. Open a map package, prove the corpus in hand is the one it was mapped from.

An engine is only as right as the correspondence between its map and its corpus, so nothing
is scaffolded until five things are shown, in this order, and any one that is not shown is a
refusal rather than a warning:

  1. **The package is a map package.** A `.nupkg` built by `tools/pack-map.py` (0015): its
     `build/<id>.props` declares exactly one `RulesFactoryMap` item, and the map, manifest and
     `ConsumerChecker` that item names are all inside the archive. A package without its
     checker (pre-2.0.0 backgammon, or a hand-built zip) is not one an engine's gate can use
     (#51), so it is refused, not tolerated. The checker's bytes are read so provenance can
     record their digest; they are never run (below).
  2. **The map is in a schemaVersion this factory reads.** The supported set is
     `SCHEMA_VERSIONS` in the factory's own `tools/check-map.py`, not a copy kept here. A map in
     any other version is refused, naming the versions that would be accepted.
  3. **The corpus is verifiable here.** The map cites exactly one corpus, the manifest declares
     it, and its `verification` is `committed-copy` (0013). A `local-copy` corpus is NOT
     VERIFIED: an engine produced from it could not re-derive its own baseline in CI --
     except under the licensed-copy exception (0022), when the caller has established an
     allowlisted operator (licensed_copy.py, which this module never imports, since it is vendored
     into engines) and passes that login. The local file is then hashed exactly as step 4 says:
     the one given on the command line, or, when none is (provenance's recompute, whose engine
     holds no corpus), the file the manifest's `envVar` names. The result says the exception was
     used (`licensed_copy_operator`), and generation copies no corpus bytes into the engine.
  4. **The corpus file is the baseline.** The map's `baseline` agrees with the manifest, and
     the file given on the command line hashes to `contentHash` under `hashDerivation`. A
     derivation this module does not know is refused -- a digest computed the wrong way is
     indistinguishable from a changed corpus.
  5. **The corpus declares whether its engine may draw random values** (0019): `randomness` is
     `none` or `seeded`. A package whose manifest predates the field declares nothing, and is
     refused rather than read as `none`: the answer is the corpus's, and a default would be the
     factory's.
  6. **The factory's own checker passes, in its consumer phase**, on the packaged map and
     manifest. Before any overlay exists this is the map exactly as published, so a failure
     here means the map does not hold under the checks its engine will run, and no engine
     should be built on it.

**A package is data, never code (0016).** Nothing here executes, imports or `exec`s a byte
that came out of a package: the map and manifest are parsed as JSON, and the checker that
judges them is `tools/check-map.py` beside this factory, loaded from the factory's own
checkout and versioned with it. The package's `ConsumerChecker` is for the engine's build,
which chose that package by exact version and lock-file hash. The factory has chosen nothing
yet when it opens a package, so running what the package names would hand the package the
privileges of whoever runs the factory before a single claim in it had been checked.

What intake cannot do: tell whether the map is *right* about the corpus (the publish gate's
locator checkers and review did that), or whether a newer version of the package exists.

Standard library only.

# What each `hashDerivation` covers, and how to recompute it from the file an engine commits.
#
# Both derivations in use today are SHA-256 over the file's bytes exactly as retrieved from
# the manifest's `retrievedFrom`; their names differ because the *bytes* differ from what a
# reader might assume, and that is the whole point of naming a derivation (corpus-map.md):
#
#   * ecfr-versioner-xml -- the XML document the eCFR versioner API serves for the part and
#     date, not the rendered HTML or the printed volume (examples/faa-part-107/README.md);
#   * gutenberg-plain-text-including-boilerplate -- the Project Gutenberg `.txt.utf-8`
#     including its licence header and footer, not the work text alone
#     (examples/hoyle-backgammon/README.md, finding 6).
#
# A derivation that needs normalisation (stripping boilerplate, canonicalising XML) gets its
# own function here; it must never be approximated by the raw-bytes one.
#
# This is the only table. Every engine's gate (recipe/engine-gate.py, `posture`) imports it from
# the copy of this file produce vendors at scripts/factory/intake.py, so a derivation admitted here
# is one every engine's gate can recompute (#106). Keep this module importable standalone, standard
# library only, from that directory.
