"""Who owns each file `produce` writes (#72, decision 0018). One table, three classes.

Before this module the factory had generated files, a one-shot template scaffold and nothing
saying which was which: global.json, NuGet.config and Directory.Build.props were written once
and then belonged to the engine, so a factory change to SDK policy, package sources, analyzers
or target frameworks never reached an engine that had already been produced. `TABLE` below is
now the only place a file's class is decided; generate.py, provenance.py and the tests read it,
and the ADR's table is checked against it.

  * **generated** -- rewritten on every `produce` from the factory's inputs. A hand edit is
    overwritten, and provenance.json hashes each one in `generated`, so an edit made after the
    last `produce` is a named mismatch.
  * **managed** -- factory policy the engine should keep receiving. Each managed file has a
    recipe version, and `RECIPE_SHA256` lists the SHA-256 of the bytes every version of its
    recipe ever wrote. On each `produce` a managed file that is absent, or whose bytes are one
    of those versions, is (re)written from the current recipe: that is the migration. A managed
    file whose bytes are none of them has been edited by hand, and `produce` refuses, naming
    it, before anything is written, rather than overwrite a deliberate change or silently keep
    a stale policy. Two flags settle it: `--adopt PATH` makes the file engine-owned from then
    on (provenance.json records the adoption, so later runs remember it), and `--reset PATH`
    overwrites it with the current recipe and makes it managed again (also how an adopted file
    comes back). provenance.json hashes each managed file once, in `managed`, with its recipe
    version.
  * **engine-owned** -- written once, when absent, and never touched again: the engine's own
    choices, which no factory change should undo. provenance.json lists them in `engineOwned`
    and hashes them, as it hashes every build input the engine owns, in `buildInputs`.

Detection compares against the recipe history in code rather than against the hash the last
`produce` recorded in provenance.json. The history does not trust a file in the engine (an edited
provenance.json cannot make a hand edit look like the factory's), it works for an engine produced
before this module existed (its files are version 1), and it makes a recipe version mean fixed
bytes: tools/tests/test_factory_ownership.py fails when a recipe changes without a new version and
its hash. The cost is that a managed recipe may not depend on the engine's name or the map, and
none does.

Anything `produce` writes must match exactly one row; provenance.build refuses a written path
that matches none, so a new output cannot ship unclassified. The lock files are the one output
not written by Python: verify's first restore (verify.py) writes them in the staging copy when
none exist, and produce commits them. They are engine-owned: the engine relocks
(`scripts/validate.sh lock`) and commits them itself, and a later produce leaves them alone, with
one exception (#94, decision 0018's amendment): a produce that changes the generated pins in
RulesFactory.Packages.g.props (a map version bump) re-locks every existing lock file in its
staging copy before the gate, because lock files resolved against the old pins cannot pass the
gate's locked restore. The rewrite is the consequence of the factory's input moving, is recorded
in provenance.json, and is committed only if the gate passes. Files the engine adds itself (its
hand-written code, lock files) match no row and are not the factory's to classify.

Standard library only; vendored into every engine as scripts/factory/ownership.py because
generate.py imports it and the engine's gate imports generate.py.
