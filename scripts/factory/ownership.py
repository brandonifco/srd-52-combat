"""Who owns each file `produce` writes (#72, decision 0018). One table, three classes.

Before this module the factory had generated files, a one-shot template scaffold and nothing
saying which was which: global.json, NuGet.config and Directory.Build.props were written once
and then belonged to the engine, so a factory change to SDK policy, package sources, analyzers
or target frameworks never reached an engine that had already been produced. `TABLE` below is
now the only place a file's class is decided; generate.py, provenance.py and the tests read it,
and the ADR's table is checked against it.

  * **generated** -- rewritten on every `produce` from the factory's inputs. A hand edit is
    overwritten, and provenance.json hashes each one in `generated`, so an edit made after the
    last `produce` is a named mismatch.
  * **managed** -- factory policy the engine should keep receiving. Each managed file has a
    recipe version, and `RECIPE_SHA256` lists the SHA-256 of the bytes every version of its
    recipe ever wrote. On each `produce` a managed file that is absent, or whose bytes are one
    of those versions, is (re)written from the current recipe: that is the migration. A managed
    file whose bytes are none of them has been edited by hand, and `produce` refuses, naming
    it, before anything is written, rather than overwrite a deliberate change or silently keep
    a stale policy. Two flags settle it: `--adopt PATH` makes the file engine-owned from then
    on (provenance.json records the adoption, so later runs remember it), and `--reset PATH`
    overwrites it with the current recipe and makes it managed again (also how an adopted file
    comes back). provenance.json hashes each managed file once, in `managed`, with its recipe
    version.
  * **engine-owned** -- written once, when absent, and never touched again: the engine's own
    choices, which no factory change should undo. provenance.json lists them in `engineOwned`
    and hashes them, as it hashes every build input the engine owns, in `buildInputs`.

Detection compares against the recipe history in code rather than against the hash the last
`produce` recorded in provenance.json. The history does not trust a file in the engine (an edited
provenance.json cannot make a hand edit look like the factory's), it works for an engine produced
before this module existed (its files are version 1), and it makes a recipe version mean fixed
bytes: tools/tests/factory/test_factory_ownership.py fails when a recipe changes without a new version and
its hash. The cost is that a managed recipe may not depend on the engine's name or the map, and
none does.

Anything `produce` writes must match exactly one row; provenance.build refuses a written path
that matches none, so a new output cannot ship unclassified. The lock files are the one output
not written by Python: verify's first restore (verify.py) writes them in the staging copy when
none exist, and produce commits them. They are engine-owned: the engine relocks
(`scripts/validate.sh lock`) and commits them itself, and a later produce leaves them alone, with
one exception (#94, decision 0018's amendment): a produce that changes the generated pins in
RulesFactory.Packages.g.props (a map version bump) re-locks every existing lock file in its
staging copy before the gate, because lock files resolved against the old pins cannot pass the
gate's locked restore. The rewrite is the consequence of the factory's input moving, is recorded
in provenance.json, and is committed only if the gate passes. Files the engine adds itself (its
hand-written code, lock files) match no row and are not the factory's to classify.

`RETIRED` is the other direction: a pattern `produce` **once wrote and now removes**. It is not a
fourth class -- nothing writes a retired path and nothing hashes one -- but a file the factory
stops writing does not become the engine's by default, so every run deletes what the patterns match
(`remove_retired`) and that deletion is still recognisably the factory's work.

Standard library only; vendored into every engine as scripts/factory/ownership.py because
generate.py imports it and the engine's gate imports generate.py.

#: The witnesses a retirement may be authorised by, by name (`Retired.witness`). A witness is

#: rests on when the record cannot carry it.
#:
#: There is exactly one, and adding a second is a decision, not a convenience: every entry here is
#: another sentence that ends "...and so these bytes may be deleted". `superseded_by_split` is the
#: overlay's (#247) -- see `WROTE_IT` below for why the record could not carry that one.
WITNESSES = {"overlay-split": overlay.superseded_by_split}

#: `Retired.witness` for the ordinary retirement: no witness, so the record decides.
WROTE_IT = None

#: Patterns `produce` **once wrote and now removes**. A file the factory stopped writing does not
#: become the engine's by default: an engine produced before the retirement still has it committed,
#: hashed by a record that no longer mentions it, and nobody would think to delete it. So each
#: `produce` removes what these match (`remove_retired`), inside the staging copy, and the removal is
#: committed with the run or not at all (transaction.py) -- which is the whole migration, run by the
#: same `tools/re-produce.sh` an engine already runs after every overlay edit.
#:
#: They are not a fourth class: a retired path matches no row of TABLE, is written by nothing and is
#: hashed nowhere. The list exists so that *deleting* one is still recognisably the factory's work --
#: the engine's `tools/pr-policy.py` reads it, so a migration produce is not read as somebody's own
#: decision smuggled into a produce update. A pattern is never removed from this list, for the same
#: reason a recipe version is never removed: an engine that has not been produced since still holds
#: the files.
#:
#: **A pattern is not a licence to delete.** Every retirement is authorised by the bytes and never
#: by the path, and there are two ways to authorise one:
#:
#:   * `witness=WROTE_IT` (the default, #243): the engine's own `provenance.json` -- the record as
#:     it stood before this run -- hashed that exact path with those exact bytes in `generated` or
#:     `managed`. A file the record does not name, or one whose bytes have moved since it did, is
#:     somebody's: it is left where it is and named in the run's output. `backlog/notes.md`,
#:     written by hand and never emitted, matches `backlog/*.md` and is not the factory's to remove.
#:   * `witness=<a name in WITNESSES>` (#247): the record cannot speak for this file, and something
#:     else can. `corpus-map.overlay.json` is the engine's own evidence, which the factory never
#:     wrote and so cannot claim to have written: it is recorded in `buildInputs`, which says only
#:     which bytes were there. What retires it is not that the factory is dropping it but that this
#:     run **moved** it, into `overlay/<entry id>.json`, so the witness parses the bytes it is about
#:     to delete and requires the files beside it to carry every one of their keys and values
#:     (overlay.superseded_by_split). The bar is the same: prove, from the bytes, that deleting them
#:     takes nothing away.
#:
#: Both answers land in the same place -- deleted, or kept and named -- and the engine's
#: `tools/pr-policy.py` asks the same question of the base commit's bytes before admitting the
#: deletion into a produce update, so the run and the policy cannot disagree about who owned a file.
#:
#: **And a pattern may not overlap a row.** `retired_conflicts()` is checked before any deletion and
#: by the tests: no RETIRED pattern may be able to match a path any row of TABLE can match, so a
#: retirement can never reach an engine-owned or managed file -- adopted ones included -- however the
#: pattern is spelled. Overlap is decided **exactly**, inside the narrow grammar `RETIRED_SEGMENT`
#: admits and `check_retired_grammar` enforces, so the guard neither blocks a safe retirement nor
#: misses an unsafe one. That is the structural guard; the record check above is the second, and an
#: adopted file is listed in `engineOwned` without a hash, so it fails that one too.
#:
#: **A file kept once is kept for good.** The next `produce` writes a record that does not mention
#: it, so no later run can attribute it to the factory either. That is the trade this makes
#: deliberately: preserving a file somebody wrote, forever, costs an engine one path nothing
#: maintains, and the run names it every time; deleting it costs somebody their work.

#: produced under a host repository does not own its rails -- the root does, and these are the

#: under the root, rewritten by every `produce`, and hashed in `provenance.json`'s `repository`

    the deletions are part of the one transaction and a refused run removes nothing; `out`'s
    provenance.json is still the record the engine had when the run began, which is what says who
    wrote each file.

    Matching the pattern is necessary and not sufficient; what makes it sufficient is the row's
    witness (RETIRED above). With `WROTE_IT`, a match is deleted only when that record hashed it in
    `generated` or `managed` **and** the bytes on disk are still that hash. So `backlog/notes.md`,
    written by hand under a directory the factory used to own, and an item file somebody edited
    after the last produce, are both kept -- and returned in `kept`, for the caller to print,
    because a file the factory has stopped maintaining and will not remove is something its owner
    should be told about rather than left to find. With a named witness, the record is not asked and
    the witness is: `corpus-map.overlay.json` goes only when `overlay/` carries every key it holds
    (#247), and an overlay that says anything those files do not is kept and named in exactly the
    same way.

    The bytes are re-hashed rather than trusted from the record, so an edited provenance.json cannot
    talk this into deleting a file: `recipe_versions` does not trust the record either, and for the
    same reason. The witness reads the bytes for the same reason again. Deletion by pathname alone
    was the first version of this and was wrong.

    A directory left empty by the deletions goes too; a directory holding anything else stays, with
    whatever else is in it.
