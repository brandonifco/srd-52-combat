"""The agent rails a produced engine carries (decision 0029), and the one reading of the
configuration they run on.

The rails are documents, hooks, scripts and workflows, recipes under `recipe/rails/` rather than
strings in a module; `rails_files` reads them, and `scaffold.managed_files` hands them to
ownership.py as managed files, so a hand edit in an engine is refused and never silently
overwritten. `.github/agent-policy.json` is the configuration they read, and is engine-owned: the
factory writes the default below once and never again.

The reading of that file lives here, beside the default, so what the rails demand of it cannot
drift from what the factory ships in it. `factory rails --check` (rails.py), `backlog.py`, the
engine's `scripts/engine-gate.py rails` and `tools/agent-doctor.py` all judge it through this
module and none of them states the rule itself.

The rails on GitHub are read the same way, and for the same reason (#231). Two tools ask whether
they are active -- `factory rails --check` from outside the engine and `tools/agent-doctor.py`
from inside it -- and an engine's own doctor that claimed protection the factory said was missing
is what a second copy of the rule buys. So which ruleset is the factory's, what a required check
has to be pinned to, and how a paginated answer from `gh` is put back together are stated here
once, and rails.py is not vendored while this module is.
