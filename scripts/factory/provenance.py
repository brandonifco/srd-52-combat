"""M4 of #3: provenance. What an engine was produced from, recorded so it can be recomputed.

`produce` writes `provenance.json` in the engine root, last, after every other step. The
engine embeds it (`<Name>.provenance.json`, from the src project) and a generated test asserts
the embedded copy is byte-identical to the file, so a built assembly carries the record of
what it was built from.

The fields, and where each comes from:

  * `engine.name` -- the `--name` given to `produce` (recompute needs it to re-produce).
  * `factory` -- the rules-factory checkout this module is in:
      - `version`: `X.Y.Z` when HEAD carries a tag `factory/vX.Y.Z` (the highest, if several);
        otherwise `0.0.0-dev+<the first 12 hex digits of HEAD>`. Twelve is fixed rather than
        git's `--short`, whose length grows with the repository.
      - `commit`: the full SHA of HEAD.
      - `dirty`: whether `git status --porcelain` lists anything. `produce` refuses a dirty
        tree unless `--allow-dirty`, and then records `true`. A factory that is not a git
        checkout is refused outright: its commit cannot be named.
  * `map` -- the package id and version from its nuspec, the SHA-256 of the `.nupkg` bytes,
    and the SHA-256 of the map, manifest and consumer checker at the paths the package's
    props name (`map/corpus-map.json`, `map/corpus-manifest.json`, `tools/check-map.py`).
  * `corpora` -- one entry per corpus the map cites, **sorted by `sourceId`**: its
    sourceId, contentHash, hashDerivation, asOf, the `corpus/` path the engine carries it at,
    and `principal: true` on the one the map's envelope names and its `baseline` stamps. Each
    carries `recomputed: true`: rules-corpus built the corpus from the bytes in hand and the build
    definition beside them, and the baseline it computed matched; it was not copied across from
    the manifest (rulescorpus.py, #558). The engine carries that definition and its expectation in
    `corpus/` beside the corpus, so the recompute below builds it again. A map may cite
    several corpora (0039), so this is a collection and not one object -- an engine built from a
    map whose rules cross two served documents depends on both, and a record naming one of them
    would asserts a correspondence it only half-checked.
  * `kernel` -- the RulesKernel version the engine references.
  * `packs` -- `[]`: no rule packs exist yet, and the empty list says so rather than omitting it.
  * `recipes` -- every file under `tools/factory/` (the factory's templates are its Python
    modules) and `tools/check-map.py` beside it (the checker intake runs decides whether there
    is any output, so it is factory code too, and a factory without it is refused), each with
    its SHA-256, sorted by
    repository-relative POSIX path in ascending byte order; and `digest`, the SHA-256 of the
    UTF-8 text made of one line `<sha256>  <path>\\n` per file in that order (`sha256sum` format).
    Every one of those files is in the commit `factory.commit` names, or the run is refused
    (`require_intact`, #232): a symlink under `tools/factory` would be hashed through to bytes
    git does not hold (and a symlinked directory's contents not hashed at all, because `os.walk`
    will not follow it), and a git-ignored file would be hashed while `git status` -- which is
    all `dirty` is -- called the tree clean. Ignored bytecode is refused with the rest, and is
    the case that matters most, because a `.pyc` is what Python runs (#373); `__main__.py` sets
    `sys.dont_write_bytecode` so a run leaves none behind for the next one to trip over.
  * `generated` -- `[{path, sha256}]`, sorted by path, for every file `produce` wrote on this
    run under the engine directory whose ownership class (ownership.py, decision 0018) is
    generated, except `provenance.json` itself. Managed and engine-owned files are not listed
    here: a re-run does not rewrite an engine-owned file, so hashing it here would make an
    engine's own edits (its overlay above all) look like tampering, and a managed file is
    recorded in `managed`. Leaving them out is only safe because neither says anything the
    inputs decide: the kernel and map pins and the map's PackageReference live in the generated
    `RulesFactory.Packages.g.props`, which is listed here like any `*.g.cs` (#66). The list is
    not hard-coded: `Recorder` notes every path opened for writing (or renamed into place) while
    `produce` runs, so a later step's output is picked up without touching this module, and a
    written path the ownership table does not classify is refused. Its root is the staging copy
    every step writes into (transaction.py), so the recorded paths, relative to that root, are
    the paths the commit puts in place under `--out`.
    Writes made by a child process are not seen; no step makes any.
  * `managed` -- `[{path, recipeVersion, sha256}]`, sorted by path, for every managed file that
    is still managed (not adopted): the recipe version it holds and the SHA-256 of its bytes,
    which are that recipe's. This is the one place a managed file is hashed.
  * `engineOwned` -- `[{path, adopted}]`, sorted by path, for every engine-owned file of the
    ownership table present in the engine (the lock files once verify's restore wrote them;
    produce's `after_restore` hook rebuilds the whole record, this section included), with `adopted: true` for a managed file the engine adopted (--adopt). The
    next `produce` reads the adoptions back from here. No hash: every engine-owned file is a
    build input, hashed once in `buildInputs`.
  * `buildInputs` -- `[{path, sha256}]`, sorted by path in ascending byte order, for every file
    under the engine directory that the .NET build reads as configuration -- or that the agent
    rails read as configuration, which is `.github/agent-policy.json` and nothing else (decision
    0029) -- and that the engine owns, as it stands when `produce` finishes. The rule is `is_build_input`, its only
    definition: at any depth, with `bin`, `obj`, `.git` and `.vs` pruned, a file named
    `global.json`, `NuGet.config` (any case, as NuGet finds it), `packages.lock.json`,
    `Directory.Build.rsp`, `.editorconfig`, `.globalconfig` or `agent-policy.json`, or
    ending in `.props`, `.targets`, `.sln`, `.slnx`, `.csproj`, `.fsproj` or `.vbproj`; plus every
    `overlay/<entry id>.json`, the engine's evidence for one entry (#247), which is covered by path
    because its name is the entry's; minus
    `provenance.json` and every file already in `generated` or `managed` (RulesFactory.Packages.g.props
    and a managed global.json are the factory's, and are listed there, once). The section does
    not say the factory wrote these files: some are the engine-owned scaffold (or an adopted
    managed file), which the engine may have edited since, and the rest (lock files, an
    engine's own `.targets`) the factory never writes at all. It says which
    bytes were there. Rule by name rather than a list of the scaffold, so an input the engine
    adds is covered without anyone remembering to add it.
    Lock files are the one input `produce` cannot see coming: it runs no restore, so the first
    `produce` of an engine records none, and the restore after it (`validate.sh lock`) writes
    them. Holding a record to lock files it never saw would make every engine mismatch from its
    first restore until someone re-ran `produce`, and a check that always fails is ignored. So a
    record that lists no `packages.lock.json` makes no claim about lock files, and recompute
    leaves lock files out on both sides; a record that lists any is held to all of them, so
    after that a lock file changed, removed or added is a named mismatch. Re-running `produce`
    once the lock files are written is what brings them under the record.
  * `randomness` -- the corpus's declaration in its manifest (decision 0019), as intake read it:
    `"none"` (the engine's gate refuses RulesKernel.Randomness) or `"seeded"` (the engine may
    draw, through that package, pinned at the kernel's version).
  * `rulings` -- present only when the overlay holds an owner's ruling (decision 0027), so no other
    record changes: `[{id, entry, span, answer, ruledBy, ruledOn, record, recordSha256}]` in overlay
    order, which answers in the engine are its owner's and not the corpus's. `recordSha256` hashes
    the decision record as it stood when `produce` ran, so a record edited since is a mismatch named
    `rulings` until the engine is produced again.

Deterministic: no timestamps, no machine paths; two runs from the same inputs are identical.

`recompute(engine_dir, produce_into, package)` re-produces the engine in a scratch copy from
the same package and the engine's committed corpus, and returns every mismatch as a line naming
the field (`map.nupkgSha256`, `corpus.contentHash`, `recipes.files[tools/factory/generate.py]`,
`generated[src/X/Generated/MapEntries.g.cs]`, `managed[global.json]`, `buildInputs[X.slnx]`, ...).
It also hashes each recorded generated file on disk, so a hand edit to a generated file (a pin in
RulesFactory.Packages.g.props included) is caught even though re-producing would undo it; each
recorded managed file, so a hand edit is named even though re-producing refuses it; and
it applies the build-input rule to the engine on disk, so an edited, removed or added build
input is named `buildInputs[<path>]` even when the edit makes re-producing refuse.
An empty list means the record is true of the engine and the factory running the check.

What a match proves, and what it does not. The record carries two different guarantees:

  * generation provenance (`factory`, `map`, `corpus`, `kernel`, `recipes`, `generated`): the
    generated files are exactly what this factory commit makes from this package and corpus;
  * build-input provenance (`managed`, `buildInputs`): every file in the engine that the build reads as
    configuration -- the SDK pin, package sources, MSBuild props and targets, projects and
    solution, every overlay file, and the lock files once recorded -- has the recorded bytes, whoever
    wrote them.

Together they say the engine's source tree is the recorded one. They do not say what a machine
did with it: which SDK is actually installed and selected (global.json names a version; nothing
hashes a toolchain), what restore fetched beyond the content hashes the lock files pin (and,
before lock files are recorded, nothing about packages beyond their versions), environment
variables and command-line properties (`CI`, `-p:...`), files outside the engine directory that
MSBuild or NuGet also read (a `Directory.Build.props` or `NuGet.config` in a parent directory,
the user-level NuGet.config), or that a given assembly was built from this tree: the embedded
copy of provenance.json ties an assembly to a record, not to a build.

        and `os.walk` does not descend a symlinked directory, so code the factory imports

    there is no honest entry for a file that no commit holds. `--allow-dirty` does not lift
