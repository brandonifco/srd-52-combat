"""Owner's rulings on unresolved questions, held in the engine's overlay (decision 0027).

An entry with `ambiguity.fate: unresolved` records a question the corpus does not settle. An
engine may decline it, or its owner may rule on part of it. A ruling is the engine's, never the
map's: it sits in `corpus-map.overlay.json` beside the three fields 0015 lets an engine set, and
it never reaches the merged map. So the map keeps saying only what the corpus says, and the
package's own checker, which reads the merge, is unchanged by it.

An overlay item may carry two keys besides `status`, `implementedIn` and `tests`:

  "rulings":  [{"id", "span", "answer", "ruledBy", "ruledOn", "record", "tests"}, ...]
  "declines": [{"span", "tests"}, ...]

`span` is a quotation from the entry's `ambiguity.question`, verbatim, that names the part a
ruling answers or a decline refuses. `declines` is required beside `rulings`: it lists the parts
the engine still declines, and `declines: []` is the declaration that the question is fully
ruled. `problems` is every way an overlay breaks that shape against the package map:

  * a ruling or decline on an entry the map does not record as `fate: unresolved`, or that the
    overlay does not mark `implemented`;
  * a ruling missing a field, carrying one it does not have, or with a blank one; an `id` that is
    not `<entry id>/<slug>` or is used twice; an `answer` that is not one short line; a `ruledOn`
    that is not a YYYY-MM-DD date;
  * a `span` that is not in the current question exactly once, or that overlaps another span on
    the same entry (one part is not both ruled and declined, or ruled twice);
  * spans that together leave any of the question, whitespace aside, unquoted: every part of it is
    either ruled or declined, so a question the map has grown or rewritten is refused until the
    engine re-divides it;
  * `tests` empty, or naming a test the overlay item's own `tests` does not;
  * a `record` that is not a relative path inside the engine, or, when the engine root is known,
    is not a file there;
  * `rulings` without `declines`, `declines: []` without `rulings`, and an empty `rulings`;
  * **a ruling that contradicts a bound the map records on the same question** (decision 0031).
    Where the entry's `ambiguity` carries `bounds` -- the authored examples that fix what the open
    term does and does not reach, in a dimension that can be compared -- a ruling states the line
    it draws as `"boundary": {"dimension", "operator", "value"}`, or `null` to declare that it
    draws no line in that dimension. A stated line is evaluated at each example's value and must
    give the verdict the example states: an owner who rules that a short temporary absence is one
    of 18 months or less is refused, naming § 1.121-1(c)(4) Example 4, which says a 1-year
    sabbatical is not one. A `boundary` on a ruling whose entry carries no bounds is refused too,
    because nothing would compare it.

What no check here can show, and 0027 says so: that the engine divided the question where its
parts really divide (the map does not divide a question into parts, so a span is only words), that
the engine does what a ruling answers and declines what a decline names, or that the named tests
surface the ruling to a caller. The gate shows the tests exist and ran. 0031 adds two of its own:
that a `boundary` says the same thing as the `answer` beside it in prose, and that a
`boundary: null` is honest -- a ruling that does draw a line in the bounded dimension and declares
that it does not passes here, and review is what reads it.

Standard library only, and imports nothing of the factory's: the gate's map-overlay.py imports
it from scripts/factory/ as well as generate.py.
