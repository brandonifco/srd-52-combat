"""Several map packages, read as one engine's map (#446, decision 0067).

Four maps of SRD 5.2.1 read one pinned corpus and depend on each other. The contract already
composes **corpora** -- one map may cite several, each with its own adapter and its own share of
the extent (0039, 0042) -- and it did not compose **maps**: `intake.py` opened one package and
returned one document.

A composition is a **union with a namespace**, and what it merges it **derives and reports**:

  * **Identity is `(package, entry id)`.** An entry id is unique in a map by the contract and was
    never unique across maps: `round-down` names three entries over these four maps, and two of
    them are different printings of the rule. In a composition an entry is
    `Srd52Combat.round-down` -- the package id's last segment, the separator, the map's own id --
    which is one path segment for `overlay/<id>.json` and pascals to `Srd52CombatRoundDown`. This
    is 0039's answer for units, one level up: identity is qualified by the thing that enumerated
    it. **A single package is not namespaced**, so an engine produced from one map is byte for
    byte what it was.

  * **Supersession is derived from the corpus, never authored.** Thirteen of `srd-52-combat`'s
    `scope: out`, `status: declined` entries name a passage another of these maps holds **in
    scope**: the stub exists because that map's slice stopped short, and a composition containing
    both should answer the rule rather than decline it. What says two entries are the same passage
    is **the span their evidence occupies in the corpus**, not their text and not their citation:

      - text alone merges the two printings of *Round Down*, which is the thing 0030 exists to
        stop;
      - the citation alone misses `resistance` and `resistance-and-vulnerability`, which quote one
        passage under two heading paths, because a path's earlier segments are a prefix test and
        two mappers wrote different chapters above the same line.

    So a declined entry is superseded when its evidence occurs **exactly once** in the corpus, the
    in-scope entry's does too, and the first span lies inside the second. A passage the corpus
    prints more than once cannot be told apart by its words, and the composition **says so and
    supersedes nothing** -- which is what happens to both `round-down` stubs.

What this module does not do is decide anything at runtime. It produces the composed document and
the report; what an engine does with a supersession is the engine's side of 0067.
