"""What a semantic review covered, and what a later change invalidates of it (#532, decision 0071).

A verdict used to be all-or-nothing about one commit (0053): it named the head it was formed on,
and a repair commit ended it. Nothing recorded *what* the review had covered, so the only honest
answer to a one-line repair was to review everything again, and a chain of repairs cost

    rounds x size of the accumulated slice

This module is the one statement of the model that replaces that, vendored into every engine as
`scripts/factory/reviewscope.py` so the engine's rails compute with the factory's code:

  * **units** -- every input a review can rest on, each with a fingerprint: a merged map entry
    (`entry:<id>`), an implementation or test file (`file:<path>`), a corpus (`corpus:<id>`), a
    map's frame (`map-frame:<package>`), the charter, the review policy, the factory commit, and
    the files that can change the meaning of everything (`foundational:`, `decision:`,
    `unreadable:`).
  * **claims** -- what a review judges: one per entry of the slice, one per declared invariant.
    Each claim depends on a set of units, computed from the map's dependency fields and a lexical
    reference graph of the engine's C#, and never declared by the implementer.
  * **impact** -- given a prior attestation and the current state, which claims are retained,
    which are invalidated and why, and whether a full review is required and why. "The head
    changed" is not a reason, and nothing here can produce it.
  * **attestations** -- the deterministic record a review leaves, and the one statement of what
    a well-formed one is (`validate_attestation`).
  * the **adversarial self-review** an implementer owes before a reviewer is paid, the **delta
    packet** a bounded review reads, and the **telemetry** that makes the cost observable.

Everything is a function of its arguments: no clock, no environment, no file system. The callers --
`tools/review-scope.py`, `tools/review-packet.py`, `tools/record-verdict.py` in an engine, and the
benchmark and tests here -- read the bytes and hand them in.

Standard library only.
