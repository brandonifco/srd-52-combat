"""`Contracts.g.cs` and `Requests.g.cs`: the typed contract over the registry (#76).

The registry (registry.py) dispatches on a string id and a `RuleRequest` that is a
dictionary of assertion values, and it stays: it is the one mechanism every entry shares, and the
correspondence tests read it. Over it, each entry gets

  * a request type of its own, `{Engine}.Requests.{Member}Request`, and a typed entry point,
    `EntryPoints.{Member}`, a `RuleEntry<{Member}Request, TOutput>`. Handing one entry's request to
    another entry does not compile. (`EntryPoints`, not `Rules`: an engine's hand-written code
    commonly lives in a `{Engine}.Rules` namespace, which a class of that name would collide with).
    The request type is `sealed partial` (#93): the map names no inputs, so an engine declares an
    entry's inputs itself, as `init` properties in a file of its own, and a caller sets them in an
    object initializer (`new {Member}Request { Position = p }`). The entry point hands that very
    object to the handler (`Registry.Resolve(IEntryRequest)`); only the dictionary dispatch,
    `Registry.Resolve(id, RuleRequest)`, builds one from the assertions, with every input at its
    default. The generated members are the constructors `()` and `(RuleRequest)`, `Empty`,
    `Asserting` on an assertion, `EntryId` and `Assertions`; since the generated code constructs
    requests, an engine's input may not be a C# `required` member;
  * a handler declaration, a partial method of `Handlers`, whose implementation is the
    hand-written code. For an entry whose merged status is `implemented` and whose row is not 8
    (the entries a correspondence test already requires a handler for) it is an extended partial
    method, `internal static partial Resolution<TOutput> {Member}({Member}Request request)`, so a
    missing implementation is CS8795 and one with another return type CS8817 or parameter
    CS0759: build errors, and the engine builds with warnings as errors, so a nullability
    mismatch (CS8826 and kin) is one too. Every other entry gets an optional hook,
    `static partial void {Member}({Member}Request request, ref Resolution<TOutput>? resolution)`,
    which may stay unimplemented and, when implemented with the wrong signature, is CS0759. An
    entry moving to `implemented` turns its hook into the required form, and the build names the
    handler to change.

Why partial methods rather than a Roslyn analyzer or source generator. An analyzer could check
`[Implements]` methods where they stand, but it is a compiled netstandard2.0 assembly referencing
Microsoft.CodeAnalysis: the factory writes source and runs no compiler, so the analyzer would have
to be a package of its own, versioned and restored and locked alongside the kernel, pinned to a
Roslyn the engine's SDK may not load, and its diagnostics would be the factory's code running
inside every engine build. A generated partial declaration costs nothing of that: it is ordinary
C# the regeneration gate already compares byte for byte, and the C# compiler itself refuses a
missing or mis-typed handler.
