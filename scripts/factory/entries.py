"""`MapEntries.g.cs` and `Rulings.g.cs`: the map, and the owner's rulings over it, as data.

  * `MapEntries.g.cs` -- one static per map entry, its citation verbatim, and the baseline. A
    derived entry (0012) has no citation of its own; its `Locators` are every citation it
    rests on (see `semantics.Model._leaf_locators` for which, and in what order). An assertion's static
    also carries `AssertedBy`, the map's `assertedBy` (decision 0025), as an init property so the
    records' constructors do not change; `draws` is not generated, because its `count` is prose;
  * `Rulings.g.cs` -- only when the overlay holds an owner's ruling (decision 0027, rulings.py):
    `OwnerRuling` and `OwnerRulings`, one static per ruling and `All`, from the overlay's id, entry,
    span, answer, ruledBy, ruledOn and record, so an engine surfaces a ruling without restating
    it. Both are partial. The merge refuses a ruling that breaks 0027 before anything is written,
    and a produce with no rulings removes the file;
