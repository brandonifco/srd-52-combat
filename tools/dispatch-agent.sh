# Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029). AGENTS.md section 4 is the rule this
# implements; the labels and the worktree root are read from .github/agent-policy.json, which the
# engine owns.
#
# The primary checkout is for orchestration, and its steady state is: on main, clean. Implementation
# in the primary checkout produces a repository where nobody can tell which change belongs to which
# issue, and where two agents working at once corrupt each other's tree.
#
# Worktrees live OUTSIDE the repository. One inside it eventually gets committed, scanned by a tool
# that did not expect it, or deleted by a clean step.
#
# Dispatch refuses work that is not ready, rather than leaving that to an agent's judgement: an
# issue that is closed, blocked, or awaiting a decision, one that already has a worktree, and a
# primary checkout with uncommitted changes.
#
# Cleaning up is not left to anyone's memory either. `--cleanup <n>` is one issue, run by hand;
# `--sweep` removes everything merged work left behind, and every dispatch runs it first, so a
# repository that dispatches at all stays clean without anybody deciding to tidy up.
