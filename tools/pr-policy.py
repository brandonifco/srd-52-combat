"""The pull request contract, checked mechanically.

    tools/pr-policy.py <pr-number>
    tools/pr-policy.py --docs-skeleton      the `## Documentation` section for this tree, to fill in

Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029), and run by
`.github/workflows/pr-policy.yml` on every open, edit, push and reopen.

**What this is for.** A pull request is where a change stops being the implementer's and becomes
the repository's, and the only thing a reader six months later has is what it said. A vague pull
request is not a formatting problem: it is a change whose behavioural claim nobody stated, whose
evidence nobody can re-run, and whose scope nobody bounded -- and each of those is how a defect
gets merged with everyone's agreement.

So this checks what can be checked mechanically, and nothing it cannot:

  1. exactly one real `Closes #<n>` -- one branch closes one issue;
  2. every mandatory section is present and filled, not left as its placeholder;
  3. the evidence section shows a command and its output, not a claim that it passed;
  4. a change touching the semantic surface names an entry and a locator;
  5. the named entry, linked issue and overlay status transition describe the same work;
  6. agent provenance says who implemented and who reviewed;
  7. the linked issue carries exactly one risk label and exactly one state label;
  8. every document this engine owns is accounted for, and what is said matches the diff.

**The documentation section (#236).** A change that makes a document untrue is not finished, and
almost none of what makes one untrue is something a parser can see. So the body carries a line per
document, each ticked with a note:

    - [x] `README.md` — updated: the entry table names the altitude limit
    - [x] `docs/how-we-read-the-corpus.md` — checked, no change: it describes the map, not handlers

**Which documents those are is decided from an engine's layout, and is not rules-factory's list.**
Almost every `*.md` a produced engine holds is the factory's -- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`docs/agent-team.md`, the reviewer charters, this pull request's own template -- and `produce`
refuses a hand edit to each, so asking an engine's pull request to account for one would be asking
for a tick nobody here can act on. What is living is what the engine owns: its `README.md`, its own
`docs/`, and any rail it has **adopted** (`factory produce --adopt <path>`), which is engine-owned
from that moment. A numbered decision record under `docs/decisions/` is frozen, for the reason
rules-factory freezes its own: it records what was decided and is superseded, never rewritten. A
fresh engine owns no documents at all, and then this section says so in a sentence -- which is a
true answer, and stops being one the day somebody writes a README.

Whoever owns it, **a document the diff touches is listed as `updated`** -- which catches a README
added in a branch and never mentioned again. An admitted produce claim is the single exception, and
only to that one rule: the claim was granted by showing every changed path is one the factory
writes, which says more than a tick beside twenty rails whose honest note is all the same sentence.
The engine's own documents are listed in a produce update like any other.

**A document outside the engine has one spelling: its path relative to the engine directory.** An
engine embedded under a repository root (decision 0069) shares its pull requests with that
repository, so the diff can touch the root's `README.md`, and the same rule -- every changed `*.md`
is listed as `updated`, whoever owns it -- applies to it. It is written `../README.md`, and
`../.github/pull_request_template.md` for a template, as `cd engine && cat ../README.md` would spell
it. An engine's own paths never begin with `..`, so the spelling cannot mean anything else, and
`README.md` keeps meaning the engine's own. The check and `--docs-skeleton` both use it. A listed path
that is neither living nor changed is still a typo.

This cannot tell whether anyone read a file. That part rests on the author's word, and the note is
where they give it.

**Produce mode (#193).** A `factory produce` update to this engine -- a new map version, a new
kernel pin, a new factory recipe -- is a pull request under these rails like any other, and two of
the obligations above cannot be met honestly by one: it writes no test of its own, so it can name
no mutation, and a map bump regenerates every entry, so it has no single entry id or locator. A
pull request whose body carries the `## Produced by the factory` section and its marker claims to
be one. The claim is **checked, never taken**, and it is closed on three conditions, all of which
must hold:

  1. it says so -- the section, the marker, and three declared facts: factory version, map package
     and version, kernel version;
  2. those facts equal `provenance.json` in the checked-out tree, and that record says the factory
     was not dirty. A produce from a dirty factory is not reproducible, so it is not an update
     anybody can repeat;
  3. every changed path is one the factory writes, classified through this engine's own vendored
     `scripts/factory/ownership.py` -- generated, managed, a `packages.lock.json` a pin change
     re-locks (#94), or the **deletion** of a file under a retired pattern whose base-commit bytes
     are the ones the base commit's `provenance.json` hashed -- the same test the remover applies,
     so the policy and the run agree about who owned a file (#243). One hand-written `.cs`, one
     overlay file, one edit to `.github/agent-policy.json`
     voids the claim, by name, and the pull request is judged as the ordinary pull request it is.

The file set this can ever cover is exactly the set nobody may hand-edit anyway (AGENTS.md section
10), so it grants no new territory. Forging the bytes is caught by `./scripts/validate.sh full`,
which regenerates every `*.g.cs` and compares byte for byte; forging the declaration fails against
`provenance.json`, which is in the diff a reviewer reads.

**Produce mode changes what a pull request must say, never what it must prove.** It waives no
verdict, no `Closes #<n>`, no label rule and no gate run. It replaces the two obligations that do
not apply with two that are harder to fake: the map package and version and what moved, in place of
an entry and a locator; and the produce command, the gate's output and a `factory provenance`
recompute, in place of a named mutation.

**What it cannot check, and does not pretend to.** Whether the behavioural claim is true, whether
the evidence was really run, whether the mutation was really observed to fail, or whether the
named reviewer really reviewed. Those are a reviewer's, and the review verdict recorded against
the head commit is where they land (`tools/record-verdict.py`). A policy check that implied
otherwise would make the pull request look more verified than it is.

Label strings and the semantic surface come from `.github/agent-policy.json`, which the engine
owns. Standard library only, plus `gh` (or `$RULES_ENGINE_GH`).
