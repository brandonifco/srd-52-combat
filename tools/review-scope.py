Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (rules-factory decision 0071). `AGENTS.md` section 7 is
the contract, and `docs/review-evidence.md` says how to read what this writes.

**Why.** A verdict binds one head (0053), and until this existed nothing recorded what it had
covered: a repair commit ended the verdict, and the next review reread the whole slice. A chain of
eight repairs paid for eight complete rereads, most of them of bytes the repairs never touched.

So a review now leaves an attestation (`tools/record-verdict.py` writes it) naming every claim it
covered and the fingerprint of every unit each claim rests on -- the map entry and its overlay
row, the entries it depends on, the corpus it cites, and the implementation and test files a
lexical reference graph of the engine's C# reaches from it. This tool compares those fingerprints
with the new head and says, claim by claim, what the repair invalidated and why. It never takes
anybody's word that a change is isolated. `delta` then writes the packet that review reads: the
invalidated claims, their entries, the diff since the prior head within their closure, the
blocking findings being repaired, and nothing else -- no conversation, because none is needed.

**A full review needs a reason.** When the change cannot be bounded -- the charter, the policy, a
corpus, a map's frame, a foundational file or a decision record moved; a file the graph cannot
read changed; the repair invalidated too much -- `delta` refuses and prints the reasons, and
`tools/review-packet.py <pr> --role semantic --prior <attestation> --package-map <path>` writes the full packet that answers them. That the
head changed is never one of them.

**Integrity.** The prior attestation is read from the reviewed commit, where the repair committed
it under `reviews/attestations/`, and its SHA-256 must be the one `tools/record-verdict.py` put in
the commit status at the prior head. An attestation edited after it was recorded does not match,
and is not reused: the review is a full one, and says why.

**Nothing is written into the repository**, and a refusal writes nothing at all: packets go to
`$RULES_ENGINE_PACKET_ROOT` or a directory beside the system temporary one, as every packet does.

Standard library only, plus `gh` (or `$RULES_ENGINE_GH`), `git`, and the factory's own model,
vendored as `scripts/factory/reviewscope.py`.
