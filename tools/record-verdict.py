"""Record a review verdict from the exact packet identity the reviewer read.

    tools/record-verdict.py --pr 12 --packet /tmp/.../pr-12-abcdef123456.review.json \
        --reviewer semantic --verdict pass
    tools/record-verdict.py --pr 12 --packet /tmp/.../pr-12-abcdef123456.review.json \
        --reviewer <id from the packet's review chain> --verdict fail --note "row 7 is wrong"

Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029).

**Why a packet identity and not the pull request's current head.** A verdict is evidence about the
bytes a reviewer actually read. The human review packet and its entry packets are produced from one
immutable reviewed commit, and the adjacent `.review.json` names that commit and hashes those exact
packet bytes. This recorder consumes that identity. It never turns "whatever the PR head is now"
into the thing that was reviewed.

If the pull request moved after the packet was made, recording is refused. Regenerate the packet
and review the new bytes. A stale review is useful history, but it is not approval of the new head.

**Why the entry evidence has to be bound.** The entry packets are the one input a semantic reviewer
is told to read before the diff, and they are built from a map the packet either held to the digest
the reviewed commit declares or did not. A packet that says it did not -- `readSha256: null` -- is
refused here rather than recorded, because a passing status formed on unproven entry bytes is
indistinguishable in the record from one formed on checked evidence (#372). Regenerate the packet
with `--package-map`.

**Why a commit status and not a comment.** A reviewer saying "pass" in a chat window is worth
nothing to the repository: the conversation ends, and what is left is a merged commit nobody can
tell was reviewed. A verdict here is a commit status on the packet's exact reviewed SHA, so the
merge gate can require it and a later commit cannot inherit it.

**The reviewer names itself.** `--reviewer semantic` records under the semantic context captured
from the reviewed commit's policy in the packet identity. Any other id must be one of that same
captured independent chain. The caller's current checkout cannot silently substitute a newer
policy for the one the reviewer saw.

**A fail is a fail.** `tools/conformance-gate.py` treats a recorded failure at any configured
context as blocking, and a later pass at a different context does not clear it. The chain advances
when a provider is unavailable -- unreachable, rate-limited, returning no verdict at all -- never
because its verdict was unwelcome. A failure is answered by fixing the code, fixing the map, or
getting an owner's ruling.

**Every verdict leaves an attestation** (rules-factory 0071). Beside the identity it consumed, the
recorder writes `<identity>.attestation.json`: what kind of review it was, the claims it covered and
the fingerprint of every unit each rests on, the findings, the parent it follows, what it retained
and what it invalidated, and why. Its SHA-256 goes into the status description, so an attestation
edited afterwards no longer matches what was recorded. Commit it under `reviews/attestations/` with
the repair that answers it: `tools/review-scope.py`'s `delta` reads it from there, and bounds the next
review by what the repair could have changed.

**Which context a verdict posts is the attestation's type.** A full or final PASS posts the context
the merge gate requires. A delta PASS posts `<context>/delta`, which nothing requires: a chain of
bounded reviews reaches the merge only through one final acceptance review. A FAIL of any kind
posts a failure, which blocks. And a carry -- a packet `review-scope.py`'s `delta` wrote because nothing
a comprehensive PASS rested on moved -- posts that PASS again at the new head, and nothing else.

**A failure says what failed.** A scoped FAIL names the claim each blocking finding is about
(`--finding CLAIM=TEXT`, or `--findings <file>`), because the review after the repair rereads
exactly those claims whether or not their bytes moved.

**What this cannot check.** Which person/model actually produced the verdict, or that the provider
chain was tried in order. The packet binding is an integrity boundary, not reviewer authentication.
Provider signatures or authentication are deliberately outside this mechanism.
