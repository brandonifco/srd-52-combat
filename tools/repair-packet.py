"""The bounded brief for one repair attempt on one pull request.

    tools/repair-packet.py <pr number> --finding "..." [--finding "..."]
    tools/repair-packet.py <pr number> --findings <path>        # or `-` for stdin

Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029). `AGENTS.md` is the contract, and
`docs/agent-team.md` says why this exists at all.

**Why.** A review finding does not end the work, and until this file existed nothing said it ended
the *agent*. So the implementer that wrote the code received the finding, repaired, was reviewed
again, repaired again -- one conversation across every round, growing monotonically, with every
later turn paying for the whole of it. In the measured session of 2026-09-23/24 the implementer
that went eight rounds cost about 45M effective tokens on its own, and what it was buying with
most of them was its own transcript.

None of that transcript was authoritative. The issue, the branch, the worktree, the commits, the
pull request and its head, the entry as the map has it, the overlay's mutation records and the
gate are all durable, and between them they say everything a repair needs. **One subagent
instance is one attempt**, and the next attempt is a new one, reading this.

**What this deliberately does not carry**: the previous implementer's transcript, earlier review
conversations, orchestration discussion, or a summary of a superseded head. A repair attempt that
is handed the argument it is repairing is anchored by it, and paying for the anchor.

**What the caller supplies, and why only that.** The findings. Which findings block is the
orchestrator's judgement (`docs/agent-team.md`), and it is the one thing here that is not derived.
Everything else -- the head, the branch, the worktree, the issue's acceptance criteria, the
entries, the verdicts standing at this head, what must be green -- is read from the repository.

**Read-only, and ephemeral.** It writes nothing, anywhere: the brief goes to stdout, so there is
no packet file to clean up and nothing that can go stale beside the state it was derived from.

Standard library only, plus `gh` (or `$RULES_ENGINE_GH`) and `git`.
