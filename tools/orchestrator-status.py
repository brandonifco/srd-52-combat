"""Where the work on this engine stands, read from the repository. Small enough to restart from.

    tools/orchestrator-status.py [--json] [--local] [--limit N]

Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029). `AGENTS.md` is the contract, and
`docs/agent-team.md` says which role reads this.

**Why.** The orchestrator's job is the *current scheduling decision*. Everything it needs to make
one is durable and none of it is in a conversation: the issues are the backlog, the branches and
worktrees are the work in flight, the pull requests carry their own heads, the commit statuses
carry the verdicts, and the checks say what is green. A conversation is the one part of the
arrangement that is lost on a usage limit, a process restart, a new session, a context that
filled, or a deliberate rotation -- and re-reading it is what an orchestrator does when nothing
tells it what else to do.

In the measured session of 2026-09-23/24, carrying and re-reading orchestration history cost
51.1M effective tokens -- over 18% of the whole session -- against 4.3M for every scheduling
decision that orchestrator actually wrote. This is the command that makes the second number the
whole cost. Read `AGENTS.md`, run this, continue.

**What it is not.** Not a second backlog, and not a state database: it stores nothing and writes
nothing, so there is no copy of the truth here to go stale. GitHub and git remain authoritative,
and every line below is something one of them said a moment ago.

**Bounded on purpose.** No issue body, no pull request body, no diff, no log, no history. Those
are one `gh issue view` away when a decision turns on them, and the whole point of this output is
that it can be read in full, every time, for the price of reading it once.

**Read-only, and it says what it could not read.** It runs no command that writes -- not even a
fetch, which moves refs, and not an ordinary `git status`, which refreshes and rewrites the index
by default and takes its lock to do it (`--no-optional-locks`, #479) -- and a GitHub it could not
reach is `NOT CHECKED`, never a clean repository. It exits 0 when everything was readable, 1 when the repository is not in the steady
state or something needs a decision, and 3 when a part of the answer is missing.

Standard library only, plus `gh` (or `$RULES_ENGINE_GH`) and `git`.
