"""Are this engine's rails actually active, or do they only exist?

    tools/agent-doctor.py [--local]

Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029).

**The failure this exists for is "I thought the rails were active".** Every rail in this repository
is a file, and a file is easy to have and easy to believe in. A hook that is present but not
wired into any settings, a workflow that runs but is not required, a label the scripts read and
the repository does not have, a ruleset that was created and then set to "evaluate" rather than
"active" -- each of those looks exactly like a working rail from inside the repository, and stops
anything only when somebody checks.

So this asks the questions whose answers are not visible in a file listing, and prints one row per
answer. It changes nothing, ever.

  * **Machine** rows come first, and are about the machine rather than the repository: the SDK
    `global.json` pins, whether anything has been restored, and whether `gh` has the field the
    packets ask it for. Every rail can be in place on a machine that cannot run the gate, and a
    report that says so only after the implementer has spent an afternoon finding out is the same
    failure one step later (#195).
  * **Local** rows come from this checkout: the rails are byte for byte what the factory's recipe
    wrote, the hook is wired to the tools it guards, the policy is one the rails can record verdicts
    under, and the gate runs the rails check. The rail bytes and the policy are judged by the
    factory's own rules, from the copy `produce` vendored under `scripts/factory/`, so this and
    `factory rails --check` cannot disagree about the same file.
  * **Remote** rows come from GitHub: the labels, the ruleset, and whether the three checks are
    required, pinned to the app that posts them, and set on this repository rather than above it.
    `--local` skips them, for an offline machine; the output then says the remote half was not
    examined, because a green report that skipped the half that matters is the failure this
    repository has twice found in its own tools.
  * One row spans both: **what merged work left behind**. `tools/dispatch-agent.sh --cleanup` has
    always existed and nothing ran it, so a worktree and a branch from a pull request that merged
    days ago sit there, and the rails look exactly as active as they would if nothing had been
    left. It reads the local worktrees and branches and asks GitHub which pull requests merged, so
    with `--local`, or with `gh` refusing, it is NOT CHECKED -- never OK.

The remote half asks the same questions `factory rails --check` asks, from inside the engine and
without the factory. Where the answers would differ, the factory's is authoritative: it is the
thing that writes them -- so the questions are not asked twice in two places. Which ruleset is the
factory's, and what a required check has to be pinned to, are read from the same vendored
`scripts/factory/` the rail bytes and the policy are judged by. Before that they were restated
here, and this report said a check was OK while `factory rails --check` said WRONG about the same
ruleset at the same moment (#231).

Standard library only, plus `gh` (or `$RULES_ENGINE_GH`) for the remote rows.
