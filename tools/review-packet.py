"""Everything a reviewer needs about one pull request, assembled once.

    tools/review-packet.py <pr-number> [--role ROLE] [--package-map PATH] [--out DIR] [--stdout]

Emitted by rules-factory as a managed file (decision 0029). `AGENTS.md` is the contract, and
`docs/agent-team.md` says which reviewer reads what.

**Why.** "Review this PR, figure out the context" makes every reviewer rediscover the same facts,
badly and differently: which entry this is, what the map says, what the issue asked for, what
changed, what the gate already proved. That is expensive where it is merely wasteful, and wrong
where a reviewer reconstructs the context from the diff -- which is the implementer's reading of
the rule, restated.

So the context is assembled mechanically, once, from the issue, the pull request, git and the
map. What a reviewer then adds is judgement, which is the part that cannot be assembled.

**A reviewer is given what its role judges, and not the other role's material.** `--role` cuts
the packet three ways, and the whole packet is still the default:

  * `structural` -- what the repository steward checks: scope, ownership, evidence, determinism,
    citation and documents. It carries the pull request's claim in full, because "the template is
    filled with actual output rather than a claim" is its check, and the changed paths **with the
    ownership class of each**, because "no generated or managed file was hand-edited" is the first
    one. It carries **no entry packet**: the steward is forbidden to judge whether the
    implementation reads the rule correctly (`docs/agent-team.md`), so the map's bytes are not its
    to weigh -- and without them this role needs no restored map package to read a packet at all.
  * `semantic` -- the entry packets first, then the acceptance criteria, then the semantic surface
    and its diff. It does **not** carry the pull request body. That body is the implementer's case
    for its own reading of the rule, and this reviewer's charter tells it not to accept that case
    as an answer; handing it over first, several pages of it, is the anchoring this role exists to
    resist.
  * `independent` -- the same assignment and the current bytes in full, with no prior reviewer's
    conclusion, no repair discussion and no pull request narrative, and a section saying so. The
    value of this verdict is independence, and independence is a property of what it was given.

**The role is part of the identity.** The `.review.json` names the role the packet was cut for and
hashes the bytes that role was handed, and `tools/record-verdict.py` refuses a verdict the role
cannot carry: a semantic verdict formed on a packet with no entry packets in it is exactly the
unbound entry evidence #372 refuses, arriving by another door. A structural packet carries no
verdict at all, because this engine's policy configures no context for one -- the steward reports
findings, and the orchestrator decides which of them block.

**Order matters, and the packet is built to enforce it.** A semantic reviewer reads the entry
packet (`tools/entry-packet.py`, section 3 here) and forms its own reading of the rule BEFORE the
diff (section 5). Reading the implementation first destroys the review: the code was written to be
persuasive about its own interpretation. The sections are in the order they are meant to be read.

**What a written packet is worth.** File output is what a verdict is recorded from, so a packet
that names an entry is written only when its entry packets exist and were built from map bytes
checked against the digest the reviewed commit declares -- which is what `--package-map` supplies.
Otherwise it is refused, and `--stdout` remains for reading a packet whose evidence is unbound: it
writes nothing, so nothing can be recorded from it (#372).

**A refusal leaves nothing.** Every file, the output directory included, is written after the last
thing that can refuse; until then the packet is assembled in this run's own private directory.

**What a review covered is recorded, so the next one can be bounded** (rules-factory 0071). A file
packet that carries entry evidence also writes a `*.scope.json` beside its identity: the claims of
the slice -- each entry, each invariant `reviews/invariants.json` declares -- and the fingerprint of
every unit each rests on. `tools/record-verdict.py` turns it into the review's attestation. After a
repair, `tools/review-scope.py`'s `delta` compares that attestation with the new head and writes the
bounded packet; this one is for the reviews that read everything: the first (`--review full`), one
whose delta was refused for a stated reason (`--review full --prior <attestation>`), and the final
acceptance review at the merge boundary (`--review final --prior <attestation>`).

**A reviewer is paid only after the implementer has attacked its own work.** A semantic,
independent or whole packet that names an entry is refused until every entry has a committed
`reviews/self-review/<entry id>.json` answering all twenty classes of
`docs/adversarial-self-review.md`, made against the entry's claim digest at the reviewed head.

**Ephemeral**, for the reason an entry packet is: written outside the repository, never committed.

Standard library only, plus `gh` (or `$RULES_ENGINE_GH`) and `git`.
